The Todo App is a basic app used for creating a Todo list of various tasks that are coming up. 
In this app, you can add new tasks, update existing ones and also delete the tasks that have already been completed.

A few guidelines:
	When opening the app, you will be greeted with a splash screen which will take you to the login page where you login with the credentials: admin, test. After logging in, you will see a demo task which has been set up. You can edit that task or create a new task by clicking the + icon on the bottom right of the screen. After setting up tasks, you can click on the task and click the checkbox which indicates that the task is completed. You can then logout by pressing logout.
